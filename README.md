## 📩 Signup Integration

Currently, the form submission is simulated with JavaScript.  
To connect this to a real email service like **Mailchimp**, you’ll need to:

1. Replace the placeholder form action with your Mailchimp embed code or API call.
2. Optionally add spam protection (reCAPTCHA or honeypot field).
3. Ensure GDPR compliance if collecting personal data.
